# Backup of Detector.cpp as of successful ONNX Runtime integration

// This file is a backup of the Detector implementation that uses ONNX Runtime
// It was saved after I verified the application runs and performs detection correctly.

// Keep this file as a restore point before making further edits to the detector.

// Note: The real implementation is in `src/Detector.cpp`.
